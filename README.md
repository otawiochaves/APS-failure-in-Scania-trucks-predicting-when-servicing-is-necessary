# Scania Truck Maintenance Prediction

Welcome to the Scania truck maintenance prediction project! This project was developed as part of my post-graduation program. The objective is to minimize costs associated with unnecessary checks and maintenance failures in Scania heavy trucks. By accurately predicting whether a truck requires maintenance or not, we aim to reduce the number of unnecessary checks by mechanics and prevent potential breakdowns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of information collected from Scania heavy trucks during their daily use. Specifically, the focus is on the Air Pressure System (APS), which is crucial for various functions of the truck, including braking and gear shifting. The dataset includes a positive class representing failures in APS components and a negative class representing failures in components unrelated to APS. It's important to note that the data has been expert-selected and is a subset of the available data.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a Scania truck requires maintenance or not. By achieving this, we aim to minimize the costs associated with unnecessary checks made by mechanics (costing $10) and maintenance failures that can lead to breakdowns (costing $500). The project focuses on providing insights that can optimize the maintenance process for Scania trucks, making it more efficient and cost-effective.

## Exploratory Analysis and Data Preparation

The project begins with an exploratory analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the variables and their relationships. Data preparation techniques are then applied to ensure the dataset is suitable for training and evaluation of machine learning models. Additionally, we address the issue of the Curse of Dimensionality, considering the impact of high dimensionality on model accuracy.

### Dimensionality Reduction

To tackle the Curse of Dimensionality and improve model performance, we employ feature selection techniques and dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These techniques aim to reduce the number of features while preserving the predictive power of the dataset. The goal is to create a more interpretable and efficient model for maintenance prediction.

## Results and Conclusions

The project aims to provide accurate predictions for Scania truck maintenance needs, ultimately minimizing costs and optimizing the maintenance process. The results of the predictive model, along with performance metrics, will be presented and discussed in the final report. The conclusions drawn from this project will contribute to the field of predictive maintenance in the transportation industry.
